The features part is a stack of convolutional layers and overall works as a feature detector that can be fed into a classifier. The classifier part is a single fully-connected layer `(classifier): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1000)`. This layer was trained on the ImageNet dataset, so it won't work for our specific problem. That means we need to replace the classifier, but the features will work perfectly on their own. In general, I think about pre-trained networks as amazingly good feature detectors that can be used as the input for simple feed-forward classifiers."

You can move them back from the GPU with `model.to('cpu')` which you'll commonly do when you need to operate on the network output outside of PyTorch.
